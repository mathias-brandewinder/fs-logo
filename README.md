F# Logo
=======

The point of this project is to provide a temporary home for the F# logo redesign effort.  
Until the actual crowd-funding effort begins, we thought having a GitHub page would be a good way to provide a transparent space for the community to discuss. 
The page [http://mathias-brandewinder.github.io/fs-logo/](http://mathias-brandewinder.github.io/fs-logo/) 
can be used to:

* Provide relevant information to potential designers,
* Discuss and refine the plan with the community.

If you have questions, or think changes should be made, you can either:  

* Directly [edit the index page] (https://github.com/mathias-brandewinder/fs-logo/blob/gh-pages/index.html)
* [Open an issue] (https://github.com/mathias-brandewinder/fs-logo/issues)
